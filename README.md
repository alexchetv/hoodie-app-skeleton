If you download it, you can rename the folder to your app name, then open
the folder in your terminal and run

If you want to get it via git, run the comment below, replace `my-app-name` with
the name of your app below

```
git clone https://github.com/hoodiehq/hoodie-app-skeleton my-app-name
cd my-app-name
rm -rf .git # remove the boilerplateâ€™s git history
